# Hatsuyuki

A brand website template designed by Isaac Addis (www.github.com/isaacaddis) using the BulmaCSS Framework.

Note: The name of the template, `Hatsuyuki`, means "first snow" in Japanese. This name was chosen because it is my favorite Japanese word and because the design is clean (like snow).

##Files

##Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository or download the repo as a ZIP file (remember to extract the folder)
2. Open index.html in your browser

**Note**: Open the folder in your favorite text editor (ex: Sublime Text, Notepad++. Notepad is fine too.). The entire template is heavily commented, so as you customize your information, it is a good practice to remove these comments as you go.
